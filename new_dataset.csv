It can't even play music on local storage via bluetooth without cutting out while operating a separate app and like sending a text. Don't buy this garbage!  Update: this phone needs more ram, it has a hard time multitasking especially off of wifi. Otherwise still 5 stars.  So far so good, it's the standard Samsung galaxy experience. It was very easy to transfer data from my old S20 to the new A16. I do prefer the fingerprint scanner on the power button on the A models over the touchscreen fingerprint sensor on the S models, it's far more accurate. I also prefer a SD card slot in the A models, which the S models did away with a long time ago. The only real benefit to an S model over an A model other than faster processor and more ram is the wireless charging, I'm going to miss that. I think a wireless charging feature should me made available for the A model phones ($50 retail extra per unit would be a reasonable trade).

A great phone"", ""rating"": 5, ""body"": ""I decided to try this phone after researching \""best moderately priced phones\"" and finding it rated higher than a lot of the companies I expected to see. It has taken a little while to adjust to a new Pixel after years of owning Motorola phones, but now I love this phone. The photos are so much better than with previous phones, the images on the phone screen are top rate, and the functions (once learned) work as expected. It is a great size for slipping into purse and pocket, charges a little faster than Google reports, and holds a charge two days for me, but I'm not a heavy phone user (calls, texts, searches and photos. I don't use the phone for games). And the price is right! I don't need top of the line, but I want really good and solid. I chose this phone because Google offers longer support than the \""leading\"" phone makers and I plan to keep it a long time. Sound quality is great, it feels good in hand, and it looks good. The only downside I have found is lack of many high durability cases for it although one company on Amazon offers one that I'm using. It and the phone have survived one drop in fine style. I will update if that information changes. If you are unsure about a Pixel, do yourself a favor and try it. I don't think you will be disappointed.

There are some cost saving hardware such as no telephoto lens and not state of the art charging speed but for the average user it has an excellent processor, a large battery and the Google software that makes photos come out as if it were a device twice the price. The size is compact enough for people with small hands but has a sufficiently large screen and it has good water proofing and wireless charging to boot and it's not loaded up with all kinds of extra software.

Back then Android was pretty rough - very functional, but not a pleasure to use in my opinion. But recently Apple started sneaking ads for their stupid movies into their wallet app. A straw too far, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. And I‚Äôm tired of their constant and excessive advertising of their services.  Pros: ‚Ä¢ Long term (7 YEARS!) of fast arriving system updates. No other Android device comes close to the Pixel series in this regard. ‚Ä¢ Great battery life! I‚Äôm a pretty moderate user so I generally only charge every two days once it hits around 40% remaining. ‚Ä¢ Like every modern Pixel device, this can be operated on a flat surface without wobbling around. Unlike the rest, this has no camera visor, just a pair of small and flat lenses on the back. Quality seems pretty great so far though. ‚Ä¢ Completely unlocked, including bootloader, so I can easily switch to other flavors of Android if I so desire. I like options! ‚Ä¢ Fingerprint reader and Face Unlock work well. Worth noting that this is not an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner so it doesn‚Äôt perform quite as well in direct sunlight or with a screen protector installed. ‚Ä¢ The price on this is really great for what you get. Comparing this to Apple‚Äôs most closely priced device (the 16e at time of writing) makes that phone look even more like the bad joke that it is.  Cons: ‚Ä¢ Entirely subjective, but I don‚Äôt love that they made it so similarly shaped to a modern iPhone‚Äôs body shape and size - flat edges and flat screen. I just prefer a rounded edge experience for hand feel. It would be better if it were a bit smaller, but that is sadly not the world we live in anymore. I‚Äôve since been trying out older Pixel series devices and will likely end up on an 8 as it is just SO much more comfortable to hold and use.  So, if you are considering leaving Apple‚Äôs walled garden, I would say this is a great place to start! Don‚Äôt be intimidated by the switch - it has been extremely smooth and Android is now not only more feature rich than iOS but also more user friendly.

My Hubby wanted this particular phone when we switched from one of the \""Big Three\"" phone companies to a smaller, cheaper service. We bought it unlocked for a GSM service, usable and compatible with our new phone plan. I've only gotten to hold this thing a couple of times, but I have a lot to say about it!  First, this phone is enormous! He upgraded from a Galaxy S21 FE 5G, which I thought was close in size, but somehow, the S25 feels much bigger. It's quite hefty in weight, too, which is perfect for the tremor he has in his left hand. Having a heavier object tends to squelch the shaking a bit. The display is crystal clear and brilliant. Movies and TV shows never looked so good on a handheld device as they do with this one. Games run super fast with no lag, and charging takes no time at all with a proper fast charging system.  And now, the feature I've wanted in a phone for a long time...? The smart pen/stylus. Man, this thing is slick. I had to use it to capture my signature for an e-sign document. For once, my signature actually looked like I had signed it. Getting the file from his phone to my PC was pretty simple to do, as they connected via Bluetooth to do so. The stylus has a cozy little home tucked into its own space and won't come out (or it hasn't yet) by just dropping or knocking the phone against something. That thing is in there for the long haul until you want it out.  This phone is everything I've come to expect from Samsung's Galaxy S series. A bit on the pricey side, but to him, it's worth every penny. He loves the Titanium Black color he purchased, as he fancies the darker colors with phones and just about everything else. At least he coordinates! The bright, AMOLED display is crystal clear with brilliant, vivid colors. It's such a neat phone, one like I've always wanted for myself, but could never quite afford.  Spring for a new phone and get this beauty. You really won't be sorry.

Date First Available	December 10, 2023","[{""title"": ""Five's No Jive"", ""rating"": 5, ""body"": ""A longtime PlayStation fan, I had been putting off getting a PS5 until the three following milestones occurred:  1) a reduction in size of the console 2) a reduction in the price of the console 3) a reduction in the price of games for the console  I thought that the introduction of the PS5 Slim last fall would spur my purchase, but Sony didn't cut the price, and even older PS5 games were still selling for $70.  But finally, during the Days of Play event this spring, Sony knocked $50 off the console's price -- I didn't want the Spiderman or COD bundles, not my favorite games -- and I decided to act. Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!  So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:  1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).  2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.  3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \""weak\"" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...  4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.  5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...  6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.  7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!  8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.  So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.  And to those who say, \""Game consoles' days are numbered,\"" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!

I've had to take a step back from gaming on pc because I've gotten tired of and am having a harder time of justifying the semi-constant expensive upgrades for a gaming pc now that I've had the recent-ish life change of becoming a single parent.  The PS5 slim does the job it's designed to and does it fairly well. The performance on games is acceptable, and I can just come home, relax, and enjoy my little leisure time actually playing my games.  Does it give stronger game performance than my pc? No, but I don't need it to. I just need it to play well enough that I can enjoy myself.

It's an improvement over the budget speaker I had before, but it's not going to blow anyone away. The bass is present but not particularly deep, and the overall sound can get a bit tinny at higher volumes. It's perfectly fine for background music, podcasts, or a casual get-together, but it lacks the richness and clarity of more expensive models.  Where the Anker Soundcore 2 really shines is its value. For what it costs, it provides a reliable and portable listening experience. The battery life is impressive, and the speaker feels durable with its rubberized finish.

Secondly, very easy to use and connect to. Battery life is excellent and exceeded my expectations, I would estimate being able to use it for about 24 hours before having to charge it, although you may get several more hours beyond that. You can charge it while using it as well.  For its size I was pleasantly surprised at how loud the speaker can get and has good bass to it as well.

The sound is phenomenal for such a small speaker and the volume is also good! It‚Äôs very cute but also insanely durable. They weren‚Äôt kidding with its waterproof capabilities! While we were on vacation and floating in the water, somehow the speaker got knocked off the dock and we didn‚Äôt realize it because the wind had picked up and the volume was quite low at the time so we couldn‚Äôt hear it anymore anyways. When we were getting out of the water, we realized it was no longer on the dock. I was able to find it off the edge at the bottom, almost 5 feet deep laying in the sand. It spent over an hour in deep brackish water! We figured it was a loss because it had already been subjected to harsher conditions that what it‚Äôs waterproofing is rated for. We rinsed it off and left it out in the sun to dry a little. When we attempted to turn it on a few hours later it came on and connected to my phone like nothing had happened and continued playing music! The sound quality was still perfect and it operated as normal (sound quality, volume, charging, battery life)! We were so shocked and it has continued working for over a year since the incident.

An Amazon Echo lived in the kitchen, the family room, the office, and four bedrooms. All were Generation 1 devices, you know....the tall tower-like devices that if they fell would severely damage your foot!!!üò´ Then one day, all of my Generation 1 devices went off-line and ceased to function!!üòÆ I contacted Amazon for help, and was told the Generation 1 devices were no longer supported by Amazon and could not receive any updates. I can't comprehend how 7 separate devices just stopped working all at the same time. My entire family has come to depend on Alexa to play music, news, weather, podcasts, and many other apps we added to the mix. I ordered a new 5th-generation Echo Dot, and it was delivered overnight. Set-up was easy-peasy using my Alexa app on my phone. It was connected to my internet, and the settings were selected in just a few minutes. The sound from my old Echo was dynamic, but this new Echo Dot produces great-sounding music with the right blend of bass, mid-range tones, and highs brilliantly!!üòÉ This Echo Dot is small in its dimensions but VERY BIG IN PERFORMANCE!!!üòÑ The bass is deeper and more pronounced, and the mid-range vocals are more defined and clear!! This new Echo has exceeded my expectations regarding punching out some music!!! This first purchase of the Amazon Echo Dot was my test device, which, if great, would be purchased in greater quantity and set up in each room missing an Echo device.I believe I'll be ordering more of these to satisfy the family!!! The design is very pleasant to look at, and the rounded shape looks more at home than my previous 1st generation units!! I set the Echo so that if I was talking to the unit and stopped, I didn't have to say \""Alexa\"" to wake the device. This unit waits for my next words seamlessly making commands flow much more smoothly!! You can also set whether the Echo, when woken, makes a sound or remains quiet. I like the awake notification especially if I'm not looking directly at the device. This Echo also has a temperature sensor which could make it more repsonsive if it were running a home thermostat!! I like the \""+\"" and \""-\"" bottons on the top of the device to control volume as opposed to turning the top of my old Echos to increase or decrease the volume. You can also, like the older models, use your voice to tell Alexa which level of volume you prefer. Whether you're playing music, listening to news, or getting a weather report, this device can be muted just by touching the top of the Echo!!! NICE FEATURE!!!!üòÉ It will remain muted until you touch the top again which will pick up where you stopped the unit!!! CONVENIENT!!!!üòâ I have also found that this newer generation Echo is much more responsive to voice commands and follows through with exactly you asked for in a flash!!! I discovered that if I didn't know how to install an app or function, or wasn't aware of what's available to run on the unit, Alexa is on the job either describing apps or functions she can perform, or she can tell me how to set up an app or functions in easy to follow clear directions!!!!üòâ I haven't in the past set up lights or the house thermostat, but since this Echo seems better suited to the tasks than my previous generation devive, I think I'll venture into the world of Alexa controlled convenience items!!! üö©I rate this new 5th Generation Echo Dot a super-solid 10 out of 10, because of the units ease of set-up, the quick and crisp responses from Alexa, the improved sound whether playing music or even just news, the addition of volume controls on the topo of this device, and the affordable price of this amazingly handy device!!!! I highly recommend this new 5th Generation Echo Dot to anyone who has gone through the same situation as I with my older devices shutting down, or to new first time buyers that have yet to experience the convenience and helpfulness of owning an Amazon Echo device!!! I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed in the least with the function and performance of this newest generation Echo device!!!!üòä Read more"", ""date"": ""Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025"", ""verified_purchase"": true, ""link"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFWBG0Y2JZ8BA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8""}, {""title"": ""Very cool and good sound"", ""rating"": 5, ""body"": ""I really like this Echo Dot!

While their Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and sound quality offer only a marginal improvement over the AirPods Pro, their overall package truly shines in other areas. It's worth noting that sound quality does improve with lossless audio when connected via USB-C, but I've intentionally minimized this in my evaluation, as wired headphones fundamentally exist in a different category for me.  Comfort is a standout feature; they are exceptionally comfortable and snug, and their aesthetic is undeniably chic. The sound signature is notably balanced, and for closed-back ANC headphones, the soundstage is remarkably impressive ‚Äì arguably their brightest shining attribute.  Battery life is robust, and they boast rapid charging capabilities. Connectivity within my Apple ecosystem was seamless, quickly establishing them as my primary headphones for use with my work iMac.  I acquired these at a significant discount, around $170 total, which was less than a new pair of AirPods Pro. At this price point, they represent an excellent value. You would be hard-pressed to find wireless, ANC-equipped over-ear headphones with this level of quality and such effortless Apple device integration for a comparable price.  However, at their near-$350 retail price, better alternatives become available from brands like Sennheiser and Audio-Technica (including either wired and wireless options). Therefore, I strongly advise against paying close to full price for these headphones. Had I paid $300-$350, my rating would be closer to three stars. (On a related note, I consider the AirPods Max to be, at best, a one or two-star product at $550 ‚Äì so, these Beats are undeniably the superior choice over the APMs). At their full retail price, these Beats simply aren't worth it, primarily due to the aforementioned sound quality and only marginal ANC improvement over the AirPods Pro.  Overall, however, I am extremely happy with this purchase and believe I secured a genuinely great deal. While I was tempted by the cuter Kim K color options, I ultimately chose the Deep Brown for a more timeless and classic aesthetic.  I am thoroughly satisfied, and if you can purchase them for under $200, you truly can't go wrong.

But if you compare it with other options out there like the Sony W1000XM5 like I did, the extra $100(it's on sale for $298 atm) you get so much more and the bass, volume, comfort, battery life, weight, noise cancellation are all better than the Beats. One thing that stood out to me was not being able to answer phone calls with the Beats, so I would have to keep taking them off. I kept both to do a side by side comparison before returning to Amazon. But this review is strictly for the Beats, and overall there was honestly nothing wrong with them until you experience other options. The sound and bass are still very great, not the best if compared to others but still great for a pair of headphones. I was also surprised that the sound level wasn't very loud at max and the bass was a little mediocre when I initially put these on before purchasing the Sony. Running a marathon with these, I will say they occasionally slipped off my head and I'd have to readjust them but nothing too serious. The Sony headphones actually need more readusting for higher physical activity workouts. When changing songs and adjusting the volume you can hear the clicking in your ear and I wasn't a fan of that either. They do have an effortless and streamlined connection with iPhone and connects immediately upon taking them out of the box. I did end up staying with the Beats over the Sony for my workouts because they are just tighter and stay put throughout my runs.  Remember to buy waterproof covers for them if you are using them to workout! The ear pieces will end up getting smelly over time if you don't.

So, they are an incredible value.  I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5‚Äôs. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke. I don‚Äôt think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has a hollow quality when using it. Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort‚Äôs buttons to the Ultra‚Äôs touch controls, which seemed awkward. Additionally, the Ultra utilize a 35mm driver, while the QuietComfort use a 40mm driver. While the Ultra may be more efficient, I think the low end frequencies suffer compared to the QuietComfort. The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite. The sound quality is second to none. It is noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp, though the highs are never harsh on my ears. The 45‚Äôs require a lot of equalizer use (+6, 0, -3), while the QuietComfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound (+1, +2, +1). Even at -3 on the EQ for the highs on the 45‚Äôs, the higher frequencies feel like they need to be reined in. Indeed, the QuietComfort just sound more refined. The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5‚Äôs and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise. I run an air purifier at arm‚Äôs length away from my chair, and a window a/c to supplement the central air, which is directly behind my head. With the XM5‚Äôs I can completely eliminate the noise from both while they‚Äôre simultaneously running. With the new QuietComfort I can just barely detect the a/c, while with the 45‚Äôs I can easily pick up the a/c. The difference here between the Sonys and the new QuietComfort is marginal at best. I should mention that part of Bose‚Äôs way to cancel noise is to pump low-volume white noise into the headphones, which seems counterintuitive, but I don‚Äôt mind it. Others may mind it, however. The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45‚Äôs in that regard. They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight. I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they‚Äôre not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time. I don‚Äôt work out, but I would imagine they‚Äôd maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45‚Äôs) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone. The XM5‚Äôs require using the app, the Sonos don‚Äôt do it as easily as advertised while using my tv for some reason and the AirPods Max don‚Äôt even offer multipoint functionality. Bose states that you get 24 hour battery life on a full charge, and I‚Äôve found that to be accurate. While that‚Äôs less than the Sonos and Sony‚Äôs battery life (30 hours), it‚Äôs more than the Apple‚Äôs (20 hour). I have found the battery life to be sufficient. If you own a pair of 45‚Äôs and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there‚Äôs not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading. If you‚Äôre looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349. I hope that helps. Happy Listening!

What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn‚Äôt for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs. 1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you‚Äôre needing help choosing that was very helpful to me. 2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use. 3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they‚Äôre lighter and they don‚Äôt drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer. Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me. 4. I have a tiny head and am a 5‚Äô2 woman. I don‚Äôt have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won‚Äôt affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there. 5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus. 6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I‚Äôve googled it‚Äôs around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I‚Äôm fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me. 7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn‚Äôt dig. 8. They look really nice. 9. The color options are cute 10. The case is nice 11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven‚Äôt had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it‚Äôs on the end of the person you‚Äôre on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop 12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don‚Äôt play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It‚Äôs completely gone. 13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.) 14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones) 15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they‚Äôre 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals) 16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can‚Äôt easily break them. 17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there‚Äôs some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.

I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.  These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.  I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.  The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.  There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.  Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.  My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.  But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.

I threw them on, hit play, and suddenly the world went quiet‚Äîlike really quiet. I‚Äôm talking about that kind of peace where you wonder if someone switched your life to airplane mode. It‚Äôs like they have a built-in ‚Äúpeace and quiet‚Äù button, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed it until I tried them.  The sound quality? Chef‚Äôs kiss. I‚Äôm no audiophile, but when I say these things make your music feel like it‚Äôs floating around you, I mean it. I don‚Äôt know what kind of sorcery is going on inside these headphones, but the bass hits just right, the mids are crisp, and everything feels balanced. It‚Äôs like listening to your favorite tunes for the first time again. If I could marry a pair of headphones, this would be my soulmate.  And let‚Äôs talk about that noise-canceling feature. I‚Äôve tried noise-canceling before, but this? This is the real deal. The outside world? Gone. It‚Äôs like putting on a cozy, soundproof blanket around your ears. I could be in the middle of a crowded coffee shop, and it‚Äôd be just me and my playlist. It‚Äôs so good, I found myself laughing at how much I didn‚Äôt know about the noise around me until it vanished.  Comfort-wise, I‚Äôm impressed. I‚Äôve worn these for hours without feeling like I‚Äôm wearing a vice on my head. The ear cups are soft enough that it feels like they‚Äôre hugging my ears, but not too tight to give me a headache. Plus, the adjustable headband means they actually stay on my head without making me look like a bobblehead. Huge win.  Battery life? Out of this world. I‚Äôm talking 35 hours of playtime, which means I can listen to music all day, every day, without having to charge them like I do with my other devices. This is exactly what I need when I‚Äôm on a long road trip or just getting lost in my favorite playlist.  In short, if you‚Äôre looking for headphones that‚Äôll make you forget the world exists (in the best way), these Sony headphones are the real deal. Comfort, sound, and noise-canceling? They‚Äôve got it all. Seriously, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever lived without them.

My last pair of NB were walking shoes and was last bought 5 or 6 years ago. I do tons of walking but don't drag my feet so the soles don't wear fast and I don't let them get wet, but it was time to get a new pair. These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15's I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don't pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don't have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can't handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this \""cool\"" looking style feature. Who knows, maybe it will last okay. The price is great too, and hope they don't read this and raise it!

This unit had only 4GB RAM and a 500GB spinning-hard-drive. So I upgraded RAM to 8GB and bought this Samsung 860 EVO 500GB SSD to replace the old spinning-drive.  This SSD arrived and I needed to buy a $7 USB-to-SATA III cable here on Amazon so I could clone the old hard drive to it. There is a lot of chatter on here about people wondering about the best ways to clone existing drives onto these SSD devices. In my case, I decided the simplest thing to do was to use something I could boot from a USB, so it wouldn't matter what operating system was on the old drive I could clone anything.  So I downloaded Tuxboot and Clonezilla and ran it to install onto a USB. Super-simple process and I was ready to roll. I then hooked up the SATA end of the cable to the SSD and the other to an open USB port on the laptop, stuck the bootable USB I had just made into another and turned on power. Booted right up to Clonezilla, hit enter through every default, ensured it was using the 500GB spinning-drive for its source and the new 500GB SSD for the target, and within about a minute it was off and running. You are presented with a lot of options. I chose the simplest, device-to-device rather than doing the source-to-image, then image-to-target. Process took around 2.5 hours and then I shut down, removed the old drive from its caddy and replaced it with the SSD, hit the power switch and the system immediately booted right up to where I had left off before I cloned it!  There are a lot of ways you can clone existing drives to these SSD's. You might even want to just fresh-install your system onto one of these SSD's and that's fine. I didn't want to take the time to do that. But for me, using that $7 cable I bought here on Amazon, with the Samsung EVO 860 SSD I bought here on Amazon, and free Clonezilla install-to-USB I was able to effortlessly clone the old drive to the SSD and boot right up with it without any issues whatsoever. I had zero issues.  A few benefits from having gone through this: 1. I now know how to clone a laptop drive to an external drive 2. No more motor to spin a drive, so no more extra draw on the laptop's battery to keep one running 3. No more heat from a drive motor that's constantly running 4. Excellent performance and speed with this Samsung  To benchmark it for you, the laptop originally took just over two minutes to boot up. After upgrading its memory from 4GB to 8GB boot time dropped a bit, to 1.5 minutes. But after replacing the hard-drive with this SSD boot time is now 30-32 seconds, from hitting the power-switch to login. And everything else on the system is much, much faster without the extra seek times and slowness of that old spinning drive.  Time will tell but so far this Samsung is functioning great, was easy to clone to, Clonezilla recognized it right away (as did Tuxboot), and it booted in my system the first time after the cloning was done. And this thing is just super-fast. Plus it's a Samsung EVO. From all I've heard and read, these are pretty reliable devices with a reliability of something like 1.5 MILLION hours. That's 62,500 days or about 171 years! Try getting that kind of reliability from a spinning hard-drive!  Bottom line is these are known to be great devices. There are duds out there but by-and-large it's hard to beat a Samsung EVO device for its price-point, reliability, and performance. That's why I spent the extra $$ rather than going to a cheaper, edge-brand type SSD. I have both old and new equipment and my older stuff recognized and worked with it just fine and so far it's a screamer. I highly recommend.

As someone who deals with large files daily, this SSD has been a game-changer for my workflow.  **Blazing Fast Speed** The read and write speeds on this SSD are remarkable. I noticed an immediate improvement in my system's boot time and the speed at which applications load. Large file transfers, which used to take minutes, now complete in a matter of seconds. This SSD truly lives up to Samsung's reputation for speed and efficiency.  **Generous Storage Capacity** With 4TB of storage, I no longer worry about running out of space. This is perfect for anyone with a vast collection of photos, videos, and other large files. The capacity allows me to store everything I need with room to spare for future needs. It's a great solution for both personal and professional use.  **Easy Installation** Installing the Samsung 860 EVO was straightforward. It fits perfectly into the 2.5-inch drive bay in my desktop, and the included software made cloning my old drive a breeze. Even if you're not particularly tech-savvy, you'll find the process simple and quick.  **Reliability and Endurance** One of the standout features of this SSD is its reliability. Samsung has a strong track record in the SSD market, and this model is no exception. With advanced data protection and impressive endurance ratings, I feel confident that my data is safe and the drive will last for years to come.  **Value for Money** While the price might seem steep at first glance, the performance and storage capacity justify the investment. Compared to other SSDs in the market, the Samsung 860 EVO offers excellent value for the features it provides.  **Final Thoughts** Overall, the Samsung SSD 860 EVO 4TB is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Whether you're looking to speed up your system, need ample storage space, or want a reliable drive for your data, this SSD is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-performance, high-capacity internal SSD.

Its read-write speed is still great (R - 545MB/s, W - 496MB/s) if compared to modern SSDs. Booting OS and loading of applications have become much faster than before (Avg. boot time - 5s). If I talk about gaming performance, it only speeds up the load up, performance-wise gain like increase in FPS is minimal (completely dependent on CPU and GPU). The Samsung Data Migration software provides a seamless data transfer to migrate data from the old drive to the new drive and the Samsung Magician software is a great monitoring + tuning app, you can tweak some parameters to improve its performance. The SSD (1 TB) has a whopping 600TBW lifetime, which means it will survive 600 TB of writing or more, i.e., massive. Overall, it's a great buy for me. If you have an SSD in mind, go for the EVO series (or PRO series, if you have that budget). P.S. - Avoid the QVO series, not much durable in terms of lifetime.

I also wanted to get a Mac that had the M processors but had decided that I wouldn't go with a big screen like last time. I wanted something relatively light. I also wasn't going to spend as much money as last time either. The Macbook Air M4 fit the bill perfectly. I'm using it now for this review. I bought it for $1,049 and I see it's cheaper now but I still have no regrets.  Pros: 1) This thing is fast! I had built my latest PC with the best components and I'm still finding myself docking this and using it instead 2) All of the creative software just seems to work better on this Mac. 3) This is the perfect size for portability. I was a little concerned that the screen might be too small given my eyesight but it wasn't a problem. Screen quality is good and I have no issues there. 4) Battery life is very good. I'm usually not doing anything power-intensive when I'm just using it as a laptop but I can generally go about a day periodically using it and not have any issues. 5) The keyboard is great - not too crowded and the backlighting is good. 6) Finally, the base model has 16GB instead of 8GB. I don't know why Apple insisted that 8GB was enough in 2025 - memory is pretty cheap and 16GB is pretty much the minimal you need now a days.  Cons 1) This is true for all modern macbooks, but you have to absolutely get what you need when you buy it. It's not upgradeable. You can do some things like get a thuderbolt 4/5 ssd enclosure for storage but you have to nail down the amount of RAM you want. However, as I mentioned above the default RAM is 16 GB and that's good enough for most people. 2) The magsafe connector is great but it does seem to come off a little too easily. It's a minor gripe at best.  Overall just a great laptop - I'm very happy with it.

Wifi works great, and so far no heating issues. Playing WoT probably isn't push it much, but it's sitting on a Klim turbo frost cooling pad, mainly for having filtered air entering the laptop.
